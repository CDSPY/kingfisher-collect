# Only set KINGFISHER_API_LOCAL_DIRECTORY if the directory the data files are saved in is accessible from the KingFisher Process server.
# Set the directory the server should look in to get the data files.
# So this should match up with the FILES_STORE value
#
# export KINGFISHER_API_LOCAL_DIRECTORY=/data
#
# eg
# A machine has Scrape installed in /var/lib/kingfisher-scrape/ and the FILES_STORE is just "data"
# The same machine has Process installed, and the user that runs the Process web server can read all the data files.
# Set KINGFISHER_API_LOCAL_DIRECTORY to /var/lib/kingfisher-scrape/data/
