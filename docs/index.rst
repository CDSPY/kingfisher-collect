OCDS Kingfisher Scrapers
========================

This repo contains scrapers for OCDS data from various publishers, using the `Scrapy <https://scrapy.org/>`_ crawler framework. 

Initially sources are based on those in `OCDS Kingfisher <https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher>`_.

It does not process, validate, check or transform downloaded data - for that, see the `Process <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ part of Kingfisher.
